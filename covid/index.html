                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory
                syndrome coronavirus.
                It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory
                illness cases in Wuhan.
                All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
                The origin and source of the SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown, although the initial cases
                have been associated with the Huanan South China Seafood Market where snakes, birds and other
                animals such as bats were sold.
                Considering that many of the early patients worked in or visited
                the market in contrast to the exported cases, it was suggested either a human to human transmission
                or a more widespread animal source.<br>
                <hr><img src="images\bat.jpg"> A suspected bat origin was suggested after 96% genome sequence
                identity was demonstrated between SARS-CoV-2 and another coronavirus named Bat-CoV-RaTG13 isolated from
                bat species which colonized a province nearly 2000 km away from Wuhan. Pangolins were also suggested
                as natural host of coronaviruses . However, evidence of human to human transmission became strongly
                supported on January 22nd, 2020 after a visit conducted by a WHO delegation to the city of Wuhan. Since
                the first outbreak recognized in February 2020, the disease spread very rapidly around the world.
                According to the
                European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, as of June 2020; 8,142,129 cases of COVID-19 and
                443,488 deaths have been reported worldwide since December 2019.

                <h1>Prevention of Covid-19</h1>
                <p2>Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection
                    when
                    they cough, sneeze or speak. Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close
                    contact.
                    Outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices
                    and
                    places of worship where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings where they talk
                    loudly,
                    shout, breathe heavily or sing.
                    The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where
                    infected
                    people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. These environments are where the
                    virus
                    appears to spread by respiratory droplets or aerosols more efficiently, so taking precautions is
                    even
                    more important.
                    Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces
                    are
                    small and without outdoor air coming in.
                    For more information Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The
                    further away, the better.
                    Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and
                    cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.
                    <br><b>Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:</b><br>

                    Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after
                    you
                    touch it at any time.
                    Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.
                    When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a
                    fabric
                    mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
                    Don’t use masks with valves.
